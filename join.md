I'm a missionary with [Overland Missions](http://www.overlandmissions.com); so if you'd like to join my team and strengthen me to serve the Lord in Cambodia, then there's several things you can do.

First, e-mail me, call me, or find me; an important part of being a part of my team is communication, we're in this together to reach the neglected and forgotten peoples.

Financially
==========

Note that in order for any donations to be counted towards my budget (I'm not permitted to launch until I've reached my goal) they have to either be annual gifts or monthly.
