Thomas Downs

I'm an aspiring Jack-of-all-trades

Current Fields of Interest:
- Photography
- Art
- Acrobatics
- Music making
- Sewing
- Construction
- Visual FX
- Coding
- Writing
- Theology
- Genetics
- Botany
- Linguistics

They're probably all just distractions from the only thing that really matters, my relationship with Jesus the Christ.
