These are some things I've written. I write under the pseudonym **Othniel Downs** when I'm not writing about imaginary publisher drama.

AMT Assignments
==============
Written for assignments for an AMT class (Overland's [Advanced Mission Training](http://www.overlandmissions.com/amt)). 

- [The Wonderful Wizard of Lifehacks](/assets/gospelofidentitypaper2.pdf)

  It's an essay that pairs a silly allegory with my testimony and excerpts from Mike Petzer's book *"The Gospel of Identity"*.

- [Farming is Unbiblical](/assets/farmingisunbiblical2.pdf)

  **Warning:** heavy satire.

- [My Covenant](/assets/redemptionpaper.pdf)

  An essay written after reading E. W. Kenyon's *"The Bible in Light of Our Redemption."*


Novels
======

- [The Fall of King Mwefu: Classic Edition](/assets/thefall.pdf)

	A fantasy story interrupted by publishing company drama. Will you side with the grumpy editor, or with the rogue translator who doesn't respect the original source?
