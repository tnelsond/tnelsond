The old retired monk sat in his hammock under the mango tree intently listening and asking us deep questions about Jesus.

"Hold on a sec, let me go call my friend and see what he thinks of all this."

So he got his friend who is also a learned Buddhist and we talked at great length. We gave them a radio with the Bible on it and now they listen to it together every evening and discuss it amongst themselves like true "Bereans."

Acts 17:11 ESV2011:
> Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.

In that same village was a younger grandfather who has also been listening intently to the scriptures for a couple months, his back had been bothering him for a long time. He had altars and stuff for worshiping other gods but he claimed they were his son's. Finally one day he prayed to Jesus and was healed.

So in his excitement he came home and burned his altars and things that were for other gods (because they were his after all) and he decided to serve Jesus and Jesus only for the rest of his life. Hallelujah!
