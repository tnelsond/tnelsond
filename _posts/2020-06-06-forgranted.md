It's often a bad thing to take things for granted because you are assuming permanence to something that could change.
But I tell you that we should take all of God's promises for granted. No I don't mean that we should cease being grateful for what God has given, I mean that we should believe his word.

> "seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue;  by which he has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust." **(II Peter 1:3-4 [WEB])**

In Christ we do not lack, he's already given us everything we need, so we need to accept that and take it for granted, but with thanksgiving.

Sometimes we think, "Oh God said that, but it's not for me. Maybe if I beg then he'll give it to me." Why on earth are we begging for something that's already been granted? Is God a liar? No! He's not.

> "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." **(Hebrews 13:8 [WEB])**

> "God is not a man, that he should lie,
> nor the son of man, that he should repent.
> Has he said, and will he not do it?
> Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?
> **(Numbers 23:19 [WEB])**

I'm always fascinated by the story of the Caananite woman.

> But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

> But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”

> Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.   
> **(Matthew 15:26-28 [WEB])**

The son of God, Jesus himself, told the woman that the promise of redemption and healing was not for her daughter; but she didn't accept that because it went against God's nature. She believed God's promises so much, that even God's specific words could not nullify his general words found in the Bible. She took them for granted and won.

Am I saying that all that matters is getting stuff from God? No! That'd be a very shallow and miserable relationship. But God has given us a job to do and he's given us everything we need in order to do it. If I'm working construction and I don't use my boss's tools then I'll never get anything done. And I don't have to ask in order to use them because I'm working for him and doing his work.

Some additional promises we should take for granted:

- "Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them." **(Mark 11:24 [WEB])**
-  "I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me, and I in him, the same bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.   If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned.   If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you." **(John 15:5-7 [WEB])**
- Praise Yahweh, my soul,
and don’t forget all his benefits;
  who forgives all your sins;
who heals all your diseases;
**(Psalms 103:2-3 [WEB])**
- "who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed." **(I Peter 2:24 [WEB])**
- "My God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus." **(Philippians 4:19 [WEB])**
- "But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you." **(Romans 8:11 [WEB])**
- "What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?  He who didn’t spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely give us all things?" **(Romans 8:31-32 [WEB])**
-  "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.  But all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation;" **(II Corinthians 5:17-18 [WEB])**
