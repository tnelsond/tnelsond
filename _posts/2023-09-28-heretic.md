The rumor is that I'm a person who destroys churches, so let me explain.

We were at the church in landbridge village to settle the outrageous accusation that I had made against their main preacher.

"What they've told you is true." Admitted pastor N, the preacher in question, "So I'm asking permission to leave this church."

"You don't have to do that," Said Pastor Suet, who oversees several churches, "let's talk this through."

Pastor N when on to explain the new (false) gospel that he believes. Basically, Jesus has come back born as a Chinese woman in order to judge the church (whatever that means). The name of Jesus and his death on the cross is not enough and so we must use the new name, "Almighty God" and believe in her and the new scriptures she wrote in order to be saved. 

I was in awe as I watched Pastor Suet correct Pastor N's errors with gentleness, love, and hidden cunning.

"So you've been learning with that group online for 7 months now, have you ever met them?" Asked Pastor Suet.

"No I haven't." Responded Pastor N.

"All of us here love you." Said Pastor Suet, "I just met Tommy and Ta today, but I'm sure they love you, they're not trying to hurt you. They wouldn't be here if they didn't care about you. But as for that other group, you have no idea what kind of people they actually are. You don't know their character or if they beat their wives or anything. It's only been 7 months, you can stop learning with them and return to us, it's that easy, they won't blame you."

"I'm firm in my belief. And it's clear it's different from the rest of you." Said Pastor N, "So I ask to be released."

"Alright. You may go." Said Pastor Suet, then turning to me privately in English, "Thank you so much for telling me about him. It's so much better that he is deciding to leave on his own rather than us forcing him out."

It was bittersweet to see Pastor N go. We all felt sorry for him as well as regret that he would not be around to help us, but also we were glad that he was not going to stay and lead anyone else astray.

"You don't need a false teacher to teach you about Jesus." I said to pastor B and the others shaken by losing their favorite teacher, "You are all capable and can teach without him, you have the holy spirit!"

We were eating brunch together when pastor N returned back to the church because he had forgotten something. So we persuaded him to eat with us.

> “To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him;” (Rom 12:20a, ESV2011)

Though we speak out against Pastor N's false teaching and the affront it is to Christ, we continue to pray for him and his family and that he comes to repentance.
