I've been working on learning the Khmer language and raising up a team to send me to Cambodia.
I plan on getting there by April or May this year. I've still got a lot of work to do and people to call and contact.

If you want to meet up before we go to Cambodia, shoot me an e-mail [Tommy@OverlandMissions.com](mailto:tommy@overlandmissions.com) or message me or give me a call.
