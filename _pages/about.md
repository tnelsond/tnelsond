> "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain." *Philippians 1:21*

I'm the 3rd oldest in a large family with 6 sisters, and 3 brothers all from the same parents. We're all best friends and it's been the biggest blessing in my life apart from knowing Jesus Christ.

My name is Thomas Nelson Downs, named after my great uncle [*"The King of Koins"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nelson_Downs). My friends call me *Tommy*, teachers call me *Tom*, telemarketers call me *Thomas*, but Jesus calls me His. I once wanted a name for myself, or to accomplish some great work of intellect or engineering, but I now see that that was meaningless and fleeting; now all that I care for is to exalt the name of Christ and raise people up to full maturity in Him.

Relationships are what matter; so I've set my focus on them. People are drawn to Jesus by seeing how we love them as Christ loves us. Christ came for a relationship with us, not to write a book, but to be married to us the church.

We're new creations in Christ. Who we used to be is insignificant. Christ has taken our sin and our guilt and our shame.

> "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new." *2 Corinthians 5:17*

We're sons of God, priests of God, heirs of God.

> "and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him." *Romans 8:17*
