<p>I’m the 3rd oldest in a large family with 6 sisters, and 3 brothers all from the same parents. We’re all best friends and it’s been the biggest blessing in my life apart from knowing Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>My name is Thomas Nelson Downs, named after my great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nelson_Downs"><em>“The King of Koins”</em></a>. My friends call me <em>Tommy</em>, teachers call me <em>Tom</em>, telemarketers call me <em>Thomas</em>, but Jesus calls me His. I once wanted a name for myself, or to accomplish some great work of intellect or engineering, but I now see that that was meaningless and fleeting; now all that I care for is to exalt the name of Christ and raise people up to full maturity in Him.</p>

<p>Relationships are what matter; so I’ve set my focus on them. People are drawn to Jesus by seeing how we love them as Christ loves us. Christ came for a relationship with us, not to write a book, but to be married to us the church.</p>

<p>We’re new creations in Christ. Who we used to be is insignificant. Christ has taken our sin and our guilt and our shame.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.” <em>2 Corinthians 5:17</em></p>

<p>We’re sons of God, priests of God, heirs of God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him.” <em>Romans 8:17</em></p>
