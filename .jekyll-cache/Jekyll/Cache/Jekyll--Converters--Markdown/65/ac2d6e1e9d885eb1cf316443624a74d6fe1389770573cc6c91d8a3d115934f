I"«<p>Interesting 3rd week. We â€œlearnedâ€ vehicular mechanics in two and a half days. We â€œlearnedâ€ 4x4 driving in a day. We studied hard thoughâ€¦ We also learned about Childrenâ€™s ministry and that we shouldnâ€™t water down the gospel for them, but that they can have the same Holy Spirit as adults. They get spiritually malnourished by being given only bible stories instead of their identity and victory in Christ.</p>
