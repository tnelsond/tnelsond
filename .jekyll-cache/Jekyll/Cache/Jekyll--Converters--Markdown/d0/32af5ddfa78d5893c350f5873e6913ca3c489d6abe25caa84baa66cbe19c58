I"˜<p>Iâ€™ve been working on learning the Khmer language and raising up a team to send me to Cambodia.
I plan on getting there by April or May this year. Iâ€™ve still got a lot of work to do and people to call and contact.</p>

<p>If you want to meet up before we go to Cambodia, shoot me an e-mail <a href="mailto:tommy@overlandmissions.com">Tommy@OverlandMissions.com</a> or message me or give me a call.</p>
