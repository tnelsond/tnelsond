I"³<p>In 10 days, my sister Joy, her husband Hopper, and I are going to Zambia for 3 months. Weâ€™re going for advanced mission training by Overland Missions where weâ€™ll learn 17 courses for spreading the gospel to the ends of the earth. Thereâ€™s so many people longing for a savior, yearning for a friend who havenâ€™t seen Christ. Weâ€™re going to the ends of the earth to share Jesus (who lives inside of us) with every person.</p>
