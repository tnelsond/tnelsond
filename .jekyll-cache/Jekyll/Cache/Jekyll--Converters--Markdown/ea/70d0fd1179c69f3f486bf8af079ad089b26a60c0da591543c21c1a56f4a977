I"~<p>Been doin some tests an’ the like, pretty fun lectures or discussions depending on the awakeness of the class, few tests and homeworks nuthin’ too crazy, day in day out. Jane-Marie had us out physical training and running for 20 mins straight, into 4 sets of 10 inline pushups, ahah pushed us hard, was fun. I heard her comment that Tommy, Joy, an I do whatever we’re asked, that we push ourselves irregardless, won’t break when tired just keep moving. That was a kindness, I like to think living your Christian life is a lot like that. You don’t burn out, you don’t stop, there is no break, or time to just “veg out”, you haven’t got an excuse, cuz the kingdom is your mission, and if you stop pushin, if you don’t challenge yourself, then you get slow, and if you’re slow, then they kill ya. So I was pleased by that, cuz thats how I’m’a live 4 Christ ya no?</p>
