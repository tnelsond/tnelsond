I"m<p>Pleasant surprise! We had some days that weren’t 125 degrees, so we had a surprise <em>Come Back Alive</em> session where we made Corey our leader and we went out into the “bush” (Outside the gate). We followed GPS coordinates to a goat and Hopper put the goat on his shoulders like Keith Green from <em>the ministry years volume 1</em> and carried it the whole way. We walked for a few kilometers, following other coordinates and clues until we came to a location where we were supposed to set up camp and survive. Unfortunately we had very few supplies that they let take with us, so we only had 2 lights.</p>
