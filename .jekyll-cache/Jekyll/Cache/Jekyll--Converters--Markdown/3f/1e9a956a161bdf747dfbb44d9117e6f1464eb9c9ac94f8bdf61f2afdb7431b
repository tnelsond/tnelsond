I"@<p>Hey everyone! It’s been a while since I’ve wrote. We had a bunch of Zambian chiefs on base a while back. Zambia’s been in a drought for the past two years, so we unified together believing for rain. It’s coming and it’s gonna bring glory to God. We went out on our sector expedition last week, it rained a bit while we were there, praise the Lord, but more’s coming. The expedition was amazing, we got to preach two to three times a day, and pray for people everywhere we went. Many people got saved and encouraged, and people are being healed, hallelujah!</p>
