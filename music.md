I play the mandolin, recorder, and ocarina mostly.

## Lead Sheets (Melody and Chords)

## Sheet Music
- [Hymnary.org](http://hymnary.org) - Has scans from millions of hymns. Can search by tunes, by meter, by songs.
- [Musescore.org](http://musescore.org)

## Psalters
- [Cgmusic.com](http://www.cgmusic.org/workshop/psametre_frame.htm) - Has many renditions of all of Psalms put to English meter and rhyme. Also, if you don't know much about how meter in poetry works they have a great [page](http://www.cgmusic.org/library/whatis.htm) on that. Basically if you know the meter of a hymn or song you can swap the tune or lyrics with any other song that also has that meter.

## Ukulele
I wrote a beginner's [guide to playing hymns.](https://github.com/tnelsond/LearnMusicBook/releases/download/0.1/ukulele.pdf)

## Recorder
I wrote a beginner's [guide to playing hymns on the recorder.](https://github.com/tnelsond/LearnMusicBook/releases/download/0.1/recorder.pdf)

I also wrote a [blog post](/2019/02/11/caseforrecorder.html) about why they're amazing.

## Ocarina
For the most part I don't really like ocarinas, but the [Coda](https://codaedc.com/) flute has replaced the recorder as my favorite wind instrument. It's way more portable and ergonomic and easier to play. At $60 it's not as inexpensive, but for the innovation and quality of this instrument it's worth it. It's made by a guy in the US who developed his own manufacturing process to build them.


## Beginner Songs
- Nothing But the Blood
- Down At the Cross
- Amazing Grace
- O Thou Fount
- Be Thou My Vision

## Apps
- [Basichords](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tekartik.android.basichords&hl=en) has chord references for most string instruments and tunings.
- [Vocal Pitch Monitor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tadaoyamaoka.vocalpitchmonitor&hl=en) is great for tuning or just messing around.
- [Songbook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bence.songbook&hl=en) is for organizing lyrics for most hymns and worship music.
- [Rhyming Dictionary](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoyapps.android.pronounce&hl=en) helps with writing poetry in meter because it will tell you the stress of syllables.
